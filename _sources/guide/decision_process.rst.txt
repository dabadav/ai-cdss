2. Feature Extraction
---------------------

The system encodes Elena's cognitive and motor scores into a feature vector...

3. Patient Profiling
--------------------

A latent representation of Elena is computed...

4. Protocol Matching
--------------------

The recommender system selects candidate rehabilitation protocols that match her motor and cognitive needs...

5. Prescription Generation
--------------------------

A weekly prescription is generated that balances protocol type, domain coverage, and difficulty progression.

.. note::
   Elenaâ€™s initial prescription includes 3 motor-intensive protocols and 2 cognitive ones, with gradual difficulty adaptation based on engagement feedback.

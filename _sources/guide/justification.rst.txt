Justification of System Design
==============================

The CDSS is designed based on clinical guidelines and iterative feedback from rehabilitation specialists.

- **Why use feature vectors?**
  To generalize across heterogeneous patient profiles.

- **Why 70% target performance?**
  Based on empirical evidence for engagement optimization.

- **Why combine motor and cognitive domains?**
  To address stroke-related deficits holistically.
